Installing VirtualBox Image
=================================

As well as the Amazon Web Services Machine Image, we also have a VirtualBox 
image of a new/clean installation of the OppiaMobile Server.

The latest version is available to download from: 
https://downloads.digital-campus.org/OppiaMobile/virtualbox-images/

The configuration is all set up with the same directory structure, passwords etc 
as on the AWS image, so you can find :ref:`all the details here <aws>`.

The only additional information you should need is the user login account:

* username: oppia
* password: default

Obviously as soon as you have installed the machine you should change this to 
something much more secure.

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Desktop
