OppiaMobile Development Roadmap
=================================

Short term
-------------

* Update to Django 1.11 LTS as support for the current version (1.8 LTS) will end in April 2018 (see: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/#supported-versions)
* Improved and more intuitive way to embed video/audio content. Requires updates to Moodle block and Oppia server.
* Adding more comprehensive (automated) release testing process.


Medium term 
-------------

* Restricting course access to particular users - for example where Oppia may be used for paid courses
* Offline data transfer - e.g. downloading usage activity from phone to computer for subsequent upload to server
* Improved gamification and linking up to OpenBadges, including gamification working offline
* Linking up to xAPI and learning record store
* Integration with data collection platforms (eg OpenSRP) - being able to launch particular learning activities within 
  the data platform, then also being able to match up data/accounts from Oppia and external platforms.


Long term
------------

* Adaptive learning content and quizzes
* Improved teacher/supervisor tools
* Integration with messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram)
