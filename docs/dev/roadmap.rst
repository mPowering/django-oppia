OppiaMobile Development Roadmap
=================================


Server v0.10.1 and App v6.5.0
------------------------------

Scheduled for release in July 2018, includes:

* gamification working offline
* transfer of courses and media files from device to device (using bluetooth)
* offline export of activity logs from device, for uploading onto server (when device is never or very rarely network connected)


Short term
-------------

* Improved and more intuitive way to embed video/audio content. Requires updates to Moodle block and Oppia server.
* Adding more comprehensive (automated) release testing process.


Medium term 
-------------

* Restricting course access to particular users - for example where Oppia may be used for paid courses
* Synchronisation between devices - extending the bluetooth transfer
* Improved gamification and implementing the OpenBadges spec
* Export activity & experiences using xAPI to a learning record store
* Integration with data collection platforms (eg OpenSRP) - being able to launch particular learning activities within 
  the data platform, then also being able to match up data/accounts from Oppia and external platforms.


Long term
------------

* Adaptive learning content and quizzes
* Improved teacher/supervisor tools
* Integration with messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram)
