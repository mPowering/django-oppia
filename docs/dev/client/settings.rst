Settings and Defaults
========================

The OppiaMobile Android app makes use of the Android build system to define at compile time some of the settings for the 
project, so you don't need to modify any source code. This is done by reading a file in the root of the project called 
``oppia-default.properties`` and creating all the necessary BuildConfig values.

If you want to overwrite any of this settings, create a new file named ``custom.properties`` and define any value of the 
list below that you want to override. Note that you don't need to define all the values again, simply the ones you want 
to override, and the rest will use the default value.

**IMPORTANT**: The ``custom.properties`` file is ignored by Git in order to hide private configuration settings (like 
API keys), so any changes you make to it will not be visible in your repository.
